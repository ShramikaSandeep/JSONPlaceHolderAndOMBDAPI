# JSONPlaceHolderAndOMBDAPI

JsonPlaceHolder API : This project shows a simple Application developed in nodeJs using express which makes calls to JASONPLACEHOLDER API.
JASONPLACEHOLDER API simply responds with a bunch of dummy JSON data. This data is used just shown on the client side

OMDB API : This project shows a simple Application developed in nodeJs using express which makes calls to OMDB API. It is a open movie database API 
which responds with list of movies and the related info . Front end is a simple form developed using HTML which has a field to search a movie by its name.
The server responds with movie title and the image of the quiried moview as a response.
